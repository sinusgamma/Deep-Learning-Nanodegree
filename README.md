# Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects with Pytorch - Udacity - Facebook course

This repository contains my submission for Udacity's Deep Learning Pytorch Nanodegree program and a copy of my certificate.

Projects:

P1: Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.<br>

P2: Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.<br> 

P3: Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.<br>


P4: Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.<br>


P5: AWS SageMaker Deployment Project. Simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

Please see the README in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).<br>

# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

## Table Of Nanodegree Contents

### Tutorials

### Introduction to Neural Networks

* [Introduction to Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/intro-neural-networks): Learn how to implement gradient descent and apply it to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
* [Sentiment Analysis with NumPy](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/sentiment-analysis-network): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* [Introduction to PyTorch](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/intro-to-pytorch): Learn how to build neural networks in PyTorch and use pre-trained networks for state-of-the-art image classifiers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks

* [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/convolutional-neural-networks): Visualize the output of layers that make up a CNN. Learn how to define and train a CNN for classifying [MNIST data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a handwritten digit database that is notorious in the fields of machine and deep learning. Also, define and train a CNN for classifying images in the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
* [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/transfer-learning). In practice, most people don't train their own networks on huge datasets; they use **pre-trained** networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to help classify images of flowers without training an end-to-end network from scratch.
* [Weight Initialization](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/weight-initialization): Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.
* [Autoencoders](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/autoencoder): Build models for image compression and de-noising, using feedforward and convolutional networks in PyTorch.
* [Style Transfer](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/style-transfer): Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implement style transfer according to the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) by Gatys et. al. Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!

### Recurrent Neural Networks

* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Time series & Character-level RNN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/recurrent-neural-networks): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text; learn how tom implement these in PyTorch for a variety of tasks.
* [Embeddings (Word2Vec)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/word2vec-embeddings): Implement the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.
* [Sentiment Analysis RNN](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/sentiment-rnn): Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if the text of a moview review is positive or negative.
* [Attention](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/attention): Implement attention and apply it to annotation vectors.

### Generative Adversarial Networks

* [Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/gan-mnist): Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.
* [Batch Normalization](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/batch-norm): Learn how to improve training rates and network stability with batch normalizations.
* [Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/dcgan-svhn): Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
* [CycleGAN](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/cycle-gan): Implement a CycleGAN that is designed to learn from unpaired and unlabeled data; use trained generators to transform images from summer to winter and vice versa.

### Deploying a Model (with AWS SageMaker)

* [All exercise and project notebooks](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment) for the lessons on model deployment can be found in the linked, Github repo. Learn to deploy pre-trained models using AWS SageMaker.
